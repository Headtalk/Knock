## *HTKnockDetector*. A simple detector for physical knocks on the back or front of an iPhone. Tuned for the Z-axis of iPhone 5s and 6 devices. Just set `delegate` and `isOn` to receive Knock events.

### Quick start
1. Drag `HTKnockDetector.h`, `HTKnockDetector.m` into your project.
2. Import `CoreMotion.framework` into your project.
3. Initialize HTKnockDetector and run
``` Obj-C   
self.knockDetector = [[HTKnockDetector alloc] init];
[self.knockDetector setDelegate:self];
[self.knockDetector setIsOn:true];
```

#### Background operation
HTKnockDetector can even run in background, depending on your background modes! You will need to set `isOn = false`, and then `isOn = true` after backgrounding for Core Motion to send the detector events during background operation.

### How it works.

1. Z-Axis, into the screen, data comes in via "device motion" on iOS. This is user acceleration, with gravity subtracted.
2. A high-pass filter is applied.
3. A threshold is applied to pass high intensity accelerations, for example .75G or up.
4. If minimum time separation has occurred since last knock, a knock is detected.

### Testing.
`KnockTests/TestData` contains suite of test data, me doing various active activities and *knocking* on my iPhone 6.

Data are all CSVs with format *[time in seconds, Z-Axis acceleration in Gs]*. Where the `testName-#.csv` file name contains an "-", then the test included "#" knocks.

Run the `XCode tests` in `Knock.xcodeproj` by going to **Product > Test**.


### TODO.
*Knock works in production right now, but the following would help futureproof:*

1. **Reflect variable sampling rate in algorithm.** *Data from Core Motion is not guaranteed to be equally spaced in time. This is especially problematic in background modes, and when resuming from background.* An update would actually use the time spacing returned with data.

2. **Fix testing style.** *Many tests do not pass, but instead verbosely print the number of missed knocks.* A `performance`-type test would be more appropriate. One solution with `XCTest` is using `[self measureBlock]` with `testPerformance` cases, in which time delays are invoked for missed Knocks, indicating performance without *failing*.

### Use on Different platforms.
Test before deploying to a new platform. Remember, `F=ma`. Different form factors (Watch, Tablet, etc) will have different acceleration values for similar knocks. Devices not created by Apple may have different accelerometer hardware, and lower sample rates.

### Dependencies.
The test suite relies on OCMock, a 3rd party framework included in this project.

The framework requires CoreMotion.framework, by Apple.
